# Lithium 🎵
This mini project consist of a virtual MIDI instrument with CLI interface, developed in nodejs.

## What can I do?
Besides playing voicings-aware chords, you will be able to make your ear familiar with basic music harmony.

## How do I install it?

To start, open GarageBand, Logic, or any other DAW software where you can plug a MIDI keyboard and play sounds.

Next, follow this steps:

1. Install nodejs on your machine. Reference: https://nodejs.org/en/download

2. Open a terminal and run the next commands to clone this repo in your machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/mauriciocarbajal/lithium.git
cd lithium
```

3. Install all the required dependencies running this command:
```
npm install
```

4. To start the application, run the next command and you should see your DAW detect a new input source:
```
npm run cli
```

## How do I use it?
First, some basic theory: `I IIm IIIm IV V7 VIm VIIØ` are the diatonic chords of a major scale.

For instance, chords for C major scale: `C Dm Em F G7 Am BØ`

This chords are mapped to keys `1 2 3 4 5 6 7`, with basic voices movement.

Many popular songs never go outside their key and rarely they use all seven chords.

For instance, to play "Let it be":
```
C G Am F
C G F (cadence) C
```

Just hit the numbers associated to each grade of the C key:
```
1 5 6 4
1 5 4 (3 2) 1
```

Keep in mind that you should think in terms of `I`, `IV` and `V` and not of D major, G major or A7. This is a good exercise.

If you are familiarized with things like `IIm-V7-I`, you will find this key mapping not random at all.

Use `<` and `>` to change tonality.

## More complex songs...
Here's where the song "Lithium" from 90s band Nirvana comes to action as an interesting case of study:

Tonality: D major

Chords and analysis:
```
D     <--- I
F#7   <--- V7 -> VIm (secondary dominant)
Bm    <--- VIm
G     <--- IV
Bb    <--- bVI     (IV borrowed from D minor, modal interchange)
C7    <--- bVII7   (V7 borrowed from D minor, modal interchange)
A7    <--- V7
C7    <--- bVII7   (V7 borrowed from D minor, modal interchange)
D     <--- I
```

### Secondary dominants
Secondary dominants are the cornerstone of popular music and jazz of the 20th century, Wikipedia says.

To play this kind of chords, simply press shift key for any diatonic chord, and its secondary dominant will be played instead.

For instance,
```
6 => Bm minor chord
⇧6 => F#7 chord, which resolves to Bm
```

### Modal interchange
Modal interchange consists of borrowing chords from other tonalities.

When we're in a major key (such as D major), we can borrow chords from the minor key (from D minor, which is F major)

You can find those chords in the `z x c v b n m` row.

```
z => Cm
x => DØ (IIØ)
c => Eb (IVm)
v => Fm
b => Gm
n => Ab
m => Bb7
```

### Ready?
Now you are all set to play the song above:

```
1  ⇧6  6  4  n  m  5  m  1
```

Can you notice the different nature of those chords played when you pressed `n` and `m`?

This way of borrowing major chords from the minor tonality always makes me think of Nirvana. Or Jigglypuff song, to be honest.

## Adding melodies
You can play a melody in the keyboard using the z row and the a row. This is clearly a piano 🎹:
```
 w e   t y u   o p   ]
a s d f g h j k l ; '
```

The `asd` row has the diatonic scale of the key you're in, so those notes probably go well if you are playing diatonic chords. 

There are some rules here, but explore and see how they sound to you. What sounds nice and why?

## Thoughts
This weird user interface will help you to think of chords as a function inside a tonality where they belong to.

Music harmony might be simpler than you think. Each particular instrument always add more complexity because of physical restrictions. Much of the time you spend learning a new instrument goes to overcoming those restrictions.

This is a small tool for exploring harmony, starting from the very basic `I IV V7 I` progressions. You can try some harmonic changes that still might be difficult for you to play in your preferred instrument. Hopefully you can find some new musical ideas to chase afterwards.

## Bonus: Leap motion support
There is partial [leap motion](https://developer.leapmotion.com/) support if you happen to have one.

In that case run `npm run leap` instead. I still haven't found a good combination of gestures to match the keyboard, but you can map some of them easily, and also use your hand as a module effect changer (such as volume or pitch).

## Bonus: Georgia on my mind
Take this jazz standard as an example of a not so obvious harmony. Could it be played on this instrumentoid?

Tonality: G major
```
1        ⇧6
Georgia, Georgia

6   ⇧4        4       
The whole day through

v    m  1         6
Just an old sweet song

2             5     3(or ⇧C)  ⇧2 
Keeps Georgia on my mind...

2  5  ⇧1  1
```
